 *         A lock helps in controlling access to a shared resource by multiple threads.
 *         Only one thread at a time can acquire the lock and access the shared resource.
 *         If a second thread attempts to acquire the lock on shared resource when it is
 *         acquired by another thread, the second thread will wait until the lock is released.
 *         In this way we can achieve synchronization and race conditions can be avoided.
